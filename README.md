simulating chutes and ladder

running a monte carlo sim on a state transition matrix that represents chutes and ladders

when I was first introduced to first stap analysis I realized this was a possibility and thought it was super cool

i also messed around with what the game length distributions would look like under different dice pmfs, thats why theres two matrix csvs

next step is to try this to discover optimal play on a game with actual agency
